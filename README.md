This repository is a collection of programs for a Java module taken in university. The topics covered were Object-Oriented Programming (which includes classes, inheritance, composition and polymorphism), exception handling, data structures, complexity, threads and concurrency. 

* To run the programs:
```shell script
javac <filename>
java <filename>
```

Below is a short description of each assignment:

**Program 1:** <br>
An introductory program to create a class that calculates the mean and variance of a particular data set. The data set can be random or be chosen by the user. 

**Program 2:** <br>
This program contains two parts. The first part is to create a program which throws a dice and the second part is to implement a shape test program to utilise the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism. 

**Program 3:** <br>
This program focuses on implementing a linked list data structure. There are two stages to this program. The first stage of the program was to inherit from an abstract linked list class in order to create an integer and a string list class. The next stage of the program was to inherit from the same linked list class to create a student list class. A test program was created to exercise the behaviour of these classes to check if they are behaving as expected.
